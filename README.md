# Advanced Flight Departure Delay Analysis Project

This project involves predicting flight delays using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build models for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression analysis to predict whether a flight will be delayed, the category of delay, and the actual delay time in minutes, respectively.

## **Project Overview**
Flight delays cause inconvenience and financial loss to passengers and airlines alike. This project aims to create predictive models to help identify and minimize potential delays. The models are trained and evaluated using real-world data, including weather conditions and flight-specific details.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used contains various numerical and categorical features such as:  
- **Numerical Features:**  
  - Weather-related: `dew_point`, `humidity`, etc.  
  - Time-related: `Day_of_Week`, `Hour_of_Day`  
- **Categorical Features:**  
  - Airport codes: `departure_iataCode`, `arrival_iataCode`  
- **Target Variables:**  
  - Binary Classification Target: `delayed`  
  - Multiclass Classification Target: `delay_category`  
  - Regression Target: `delay_time_mins`  

## **Detailed Code Explanation**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
The preprocessing steps involve handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. Here's a breakdown of the key steps performed in the code:

#### **Loading the Data**
The data is loaded using `pandas`. This includes both the input features and target labels for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression models.

#### **Handling Missing Values**
The dataset is first checked for missing values using `pandas.isnull()`. Any rows containing missing values are either imputed or dropped, depending on the proportion of missing data.

#### **Encoding Categorical Variables**
Since machine learning models require numeric input, categorical variables such as `departure_iataCode` and `arrival_iataCode` are encoded using **One-Hot Encoding**. One-Hot Encoding creates binary columns for each category, allowing models to interpret categorical data correctly.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

encoder = OneHotEncoder(drop='first')  # Dropping the first category to avoid multicollinearity
encoded_features = encoder.fit_transform(categorical_data)
```

#### **Scaling Numerical Features**
Numerical features are scaled using **StandardScaler**, which standardizes the data by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model and prevents certain features with large magnitudes from dominating the predictions.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_numeric_features = scaler.fit_transform(numeric_data)
```

#### **Splitting the Data**
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio. This allows the models to be trained on a large portion of the data and tested on an unseen portion to evaluate their performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### **2. Modeling**

The code includes three main types of models:

#### **Binary Classification**
- **Objective:** Predict whether a flight will be delayed (`0` for On-Time, `1` for Delayed).  
- **Models Used:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Grid Search is performed to optimize the model parameters.  
- **Evaluation:**  
  The models are evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  

#### **Multiclass Classification**
- **Objective:** Predict the delay category:  
  - `0`: No Delay  
  - `1`: Short Delay  
  - `2`: Moderate Delay  
  - `3`: Long Delay  
- **Models Used:**  
  - Multinomial Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- **Evaluation:**  
  Accuracy and a confusion matrix are used to evaluate performance.  

#### **Regression Analysis**
- **Objective:** Predict the exact delay time in minutes.  
- **Model Used:**  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Randomized Search is performed to optimize hyperparameters like the number of estimators and max depth.  
- **Evaluation:**  
  The models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
